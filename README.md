### ENCODER 8TO3 DATAFLOW Modelling

**AIM:**

To implement  Encoder 8 To 3 in Dataflow Modelling using verilog and validating their functionality using their functional tables

**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:** Quartus prime

**THEORY**

**Encoder 8 To 3**

The 8 to 3 line Encoder is also known as Octal to Binary Encoder. In 8 to 3 line encoder, there is a total of eight inputs, i.e., D0, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, and D7 and three outputs, i.e., A0, A1, and A2. In 8-input lines, one input-line is set to true at a time to get the respective binary code in the output side. Below are the block diagram and the truth table of the 8 to 3 line encoder.

The logical expression of the term A0, A1, and A2 are as follows:

A0 = D1 + D3 + D5 + D7

A1 = D2 + D3 + D6 + D7

A2 = D4 + D5 + D6 + D7

Logical circuit of the above expressions is given below:

**Procedure**

Step1: Define the specifications and initialize the design.
Step2: Declare the name of the entity and architecture by using VHDL source code.
Step3: Write the source code in VERILOG.
Step4: Check the syntax and debug the errors if found, obtain the synthesis report.
Step5: Verify the output by simulating the source code.
Step6: Write all possible combinations of input using the test bench.
Step7: Obtain the place and route report.

**PROGRAM**

/* Program for Encoder 8 To 3 in Dataflow Modelling and verify its truth table in quartus using Verilog programming. 

```
module encod_data(d, x, y, z);
 input [7:0] d;
 output x;
 output y;
 output z;
assign#3 x=d[4]|d[5]|d[6]|d[7];
assign#3 y=d[2]|d[3]|d[6]|d[7];
assign#3 z=d[1]|d[3]|d[5]|d[7];
endmodule
```
